# Note Toolbar

The Note Toolbar plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) provides a flexible way to create toolbars at the top of your notes.

With this plugin, you also get [Note Toolbar Callouts](#note-toolbar-callouts) which you can add anywhere in your notes.

3. Scroll to the _Beta Plugin List_ section
4. _Add Beta Plugin_
5. Specify this repository: `chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar`
6. _Enable the Note Toolbar plugin_ (_Settings -> Community Plugins_)

# Getting Started üöÄ

Once installed and enabled, in Note Toolbar's settings:

1. Create a _+ New toolbar_
2. Give the toolbar a _name_.
3. _+ Add toolbar item_
4. Exit settings, and _open a note_.
5. Add a `notetoolbar` property. Set it to the name of your toolbar.

Try mapping a folder, like whever your Daily Notes are stored, to your new toolbar.

# Examples

Any plugin that can generate a URL can be executed from the toolbar. [See the wiki](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki) for detailed instructions, and more examples to come.

Some quick examples:

| Example | How? |
| --- | --- |
| Link to Next, Previous, and Today's Daily Note | Use the Core _Daily notes_ plugin + [Advanced URI](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri) ([Instructions](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Daily-Notes)) |
| Insert Template | Use [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)'s `Open insert template modal` command + [Advanced URI](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri) ([Instructions](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Templates)) |
| Show Bookmarks | Open the Bookmarks panel with the `Bookmarks: Show bookmarks` command + [Advanced URI](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri) ([Instructions](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Bookmarks)), OR use a [Note Toolbar Callout](#note-toolbar-callouts) and [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) to generate a toolbar with your bookmarks. ([Instructions](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Bookmarks)) |
| Execute Shell Commands | Using the [Shell Commands](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands) plugin. ([Instructions](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Shell-Commands)) |

[Let me know](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions) how you use your toolbars, and I'll add them to [the wiki](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki)!

# Settings Guide üõ†Ô∏è

Once installed, in Obsidian go to: _Settings... > Note Toolbar_ and click _+ New toolbar_.

## Creating Note Toolbars

### Name

Give your toolbar a name. This name will be used from your note properties, or when mapping folders (see below).

### Items

Add each item to your toolbar:

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Item label | What's shown on the toolbar |
| Tooltip | Displayed on hovering over the item on the toolbar. Nothing is displayed if this is not set. |
| URL | What the item links to. See the [URLs](#urls) section. |
| Hide on mobile | Enable this to simplify your experience on mobile due to limited screen real-estate, or for items that just don't work on mobile (e.g., Shell Commands). |
| Hide on desktop | If you have items you prefer not to see on desktop. |

#### URLs

Toolbar items can link to notes, or URLs (linking to internal or external locations). For examples, and directions on how to generate URLs, see [the wiki](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki).

The following variables are supported, which are substituted on click:

| Variable | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `{{note_title}}` | The title (a.k.a. basename) of the current note. |
| `{{prop_NAME}}` | Property in the current note with the given name. If the property does not exist, the variable will not be substitued. e.g., if you have a property called "date" use `{{prop_date}}` |

Variable values are [encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) for safety.

[Let me know](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions) what else you might want to add.

### Styles

Styles define how the toolbar will look (and behave).

Add them to the _Defaults_ section. In the _Mobile_ section, you can add equivalent styles that allow you to override these defaults, on mobile.

In the example below, on mobile the toolbar will _not_ have a border, and _not_ be sticky, but the items will stay as right aligned.  

![Styles settings example showing how default styles can be overridden](./docs/styles_settings.png)

Here's how they're applied:

| Style | Example/Clarification |
| --- | --- |
| border | <img src="./docs/style_border_even.png" width="600"/> |
| no border | <img src="./docs/style_noborder.png" width="600"/><br/>simply remove the `border` style if you don't want a border; use `no border` if you don't want a border on mobile |
| center items | <img src="./docs/style_center.png" width="600"/> |
| evenly space items | <img src="./docs/style_border_even.png" width="600"/> |
| left align items | <img src="./docs/style_left.png" width="600"/><br/>this is the default alignment; use this if you want left alignment on mobile |
| right align items | <img src="./docs/style_right.png" width="600"/> |
| float left | floats the toolbar left of nearby content |
| float right | floats the toolbar right of nearby content |
| no float | |
| sticky | sticks toolbar to top on scroll |
| not sticky | simply remove the `sticky` style if you don't it to stick; use `not sticky` if you don't want it to stick on mobile |

_Notes on precedence:_
- Styles are applied in the order you add them in settings. Per how CSS works, styles later in the lists take precedence.
- In case it helps, styles are defined alphabetically in [styles.css](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/blob/master/styles.css) (with the exception of float being at the top).

## Defining where Note Toolbars are applied

Tell the plugin which notes to display toolbars on, in one of two ways: based on a property, or based on the folder the note is in.

### Note property

Set the `notetoolbar` property on your note with the name of the toolbar you want to display.

Change what property to use by looking at by changing the `Property` setting.

If you prefer not to use properties, try Folder Mappings.

### Folder Mappings

Specify the folders you want your toolbars to appear on.

For example, if your daily notes are all in the same root folder, just specify that folder and map it to your "Daily Notes" toolbar, and it will appear on all existing, and new daily notes.

_Notes on precedence_:
- Notes are matched to folders starting from the top of the list.
- If you have a property on a given note, it will override the folder mapping.

# Note Toolbar Callouts

Toolbars are actually callouts! You can use a toolbar callout directly, to add a toolbar in the middle of your notes, for example. 

![Demo of a callout turning into a toolbar](./docs/callout_demo.gif)

This feature allows for more flexibility, and using other plugins (e.g., Templater, Dataview) to generate the contents of the toolbar.

## How to use Toolbar Callouts

Create a toolbar by creating a callout containing any list, like this:
```markdown
> [!note-toolbar]
> - [Link Menu Item](obsidian://...)
> - [[Page Menu Item]]
> - Menu Item That Won't Do Anything
```

To control its appearance, optionally add metadata by adding a | and listing styles, for example:
```markdown
> [!note-toolbar|border-right-sticky]
```

Refer directly to the [styles.css](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/blob/master/styles.css) for the literal style names.

Examples:

# Known Issues

‚ö†Ô∏è Note Toolbar isn‚Äôt officially released, or added in Community Plugins yet, as I aim to work out some of these issues (if possible, given what I can do with Obsidian‚Äôs plugin API). In spite of those issues, you're welcome to install it [via BRAT](#installing-via-brat). I welcome [your feedback](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions)!

- Toolbar disappears occasionally.
  - I believe this is due to how layouts are rendered: the events I have access to are firing _before_ the properties and editor content is available to add the toolbar to.
  - This is also a result of having to change rendering to handle switching between preview/reading and source/editing modes.
- Minimal theme + sticky toolbars: Toolbar showing underneath the top navigation.
  - I‚Äôm trying to figure out a value for `top:` style that works based on a CSS variable perhaps, but haven‚Äôt figured this out yet.

# Troubleshooting

## I want to link a toolbar item to a note...

Simply enter the name of the note in the URL. If it doesn't exist on click, a new one will be created (per Obsidian's default behavior).

You can also link to items within your vault by getting a URL to a note (`Copy Obsidian URL`) or from a plugin (e.g., Advanced URI).

## The styling of my toolbar looks weird...

See the notes in the [Styles](#styles) section around precedence.

However, if you use other plugins or themes that modify how callouts behave or look, they _may_ have an effect on this plugin. 

As noted, toolbars are a special form of callout, designed to fit naturally with Obsidian's look and feel. The plugin inserts between the metadata and content portions of the editor view, assuming certain criteria are met.

Please [log an issue](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/issues) if you think there‚Äôs a conflict with a theme, for example, that can be resolved in the plugin itself (e.g., missed a style that needs to be overridden). Pull requests are also welcome.

If you prefer to workaround any issues in the short term, styling is handled in [styles.css](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/blob/master/styles.css) by `.callout[data-callout="note-toolbar"]`.
