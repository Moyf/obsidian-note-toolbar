# Note Toolbar

The Note Toolbar plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) provides a flexible way to create toolbars at the top of your notes.

With this plugin, you also get [Note Toolbar Callouts](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki/Note-Toolbar-Callouts) which you can add anywhere in your notes.

# Installation

## Installing via Community Plugins

- [ ] TBD - This plugin is not yet released as I work out the details, but you're welcome to install it via BRAT. I welcome [your feedback](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/discussions)!

## Installing via BRAT

[BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) lets you beta-test plugins, to provide feedback.

1. Install the BRAT plugin:
  - Open _Settings > Community Plugins_
  - _Disable safe mode_, if enabled
  - Browse, and _search for "BRAT"_
  - Install the latest version of _Obsidian 42 - BRAT_
2. Open BRAT settings (_Settings -> Obsidian 42 - BRAT_)
3. Scroll to the _Beta Plugin List_ section
4. _Add Beta Plugin_
5. Specify this repository: `chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar`
6. _Enable the Note Toolbar plugin_ (_Settings -> Community Plugins_)

# Getting Started üöÄ

Once installed and enabled, in Note Toolbar's settings:

1. Create a _+ New toolbar_
2. Give the toolbar a _name_.
3. _+ Add toolbar item_
4. Exit settings, and _open a note_.
5. Add a `notetoolbar` property. Set it to the name of your toolbar.

If you want your toolbar to show without using a property, try mapping a folder (like wherever your Daily Notes are stored) to your new toolbar.

# Examples

Any plugin that can generate a URL can be executed from the toolbar. [See the User Guide](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar/wiki) for detailed instructions, and more examples to come.
